How does Disney intregrate ML tools in their data pipelines?
- They use MLFlow and Airflow interchangeble
- set up a good range of behavior to understand 
- create test data
	- For example, for name checking, test data is useful to understando patterns and to train a good model.
- create baselines on product releases, to see where correlation happens
	- understand user behavior
	- in sql this is improbable to do
- with profiling, just select columns that matter.
