True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

- answers: how complete is my detection?
- High recall: catching most anomalies
- Important when missing positives is costly (diseases treatment should be high recalls)
- Mammogram screening: High recall (catch all possible cases) â†’ many false positives
