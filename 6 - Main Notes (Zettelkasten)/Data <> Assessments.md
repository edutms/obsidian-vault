Talk to the assessment team on how this bi-monthly forum will be focused on the allignment of data and the Product team working on assessments that we are to use it to understand how to better leverage the metrics we want to build to keep track of the pilot

#### To show
- we already connected to the Pendo API, so once the Assessment Pilot is in place we can 
  also there we can:
  - track
  - create dashboards in Pendo
  - and export Pendo data to the platform
- talks with Michaela to understand from her perspective which are the best user experience and which would be the optimal user flow

**Data requests for pilot experience**  
- Path â†’ how users are navigating thru pilot screens
- Time on section/screen
- Slideout metrics

- Are users clicking
- What tabs w/in the modal are they viewing
- Time in slideout

- Drop-off - when/where are users exiting the experience

#### To ask
- any ideias for what metrics they would like to start measuring
- Do we want to measure Pilot or jump straight to the MVP experience?
	- Michaela - MVP would make more sense
	- What are the click rate on the pilot experience
- Pendo limitations
