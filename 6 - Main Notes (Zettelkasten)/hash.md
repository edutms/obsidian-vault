# Hash

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of an arbitrary size to a fixed-sized value. The values that this function returns are called hash *values*, *codes* or *hashes*. 

Has functions and hash tables are used in data storage and retrieval application to access data in a small and constant time per retrieval, making hashing computationally and storage efficient form of data access that avoids non-constant access time of ordered and unordered lists and structured trees.
