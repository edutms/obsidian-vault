# Overfitting

### What is overfitting?
- Overfitting is an algo that has low bias in regards to what it promotes.
- It leads to the cost function = 0 since the errors are equal to zero.
### What it causes?
It does not generalize to other inputs added to your model

### How to address overfitting
- collect more data
- use less features in lieau of insufficient data
	- feature selection is key in this example
- Regularization
	- encourage the learning algo to reduce the parameters size for Wj
