# What is  Python io module?

io module provides easines when working with I/O (input output). In my usecase, it's has been useful to transform byte-like responses (usually from s3) to make them become file-like objects that can be parsed as .pdf or any other type of file interpreter - in this case, PyMuPDF4llm and thus to .md format.
