# What is  Precision (Machine Learning)?

True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

For example, for all accounts flagged as anomalies, how many actually ARE anomalies (TP).

- Answers: How accurate are my positive predictions?
- High precision = few false alarms
- Important when false positives are costly (you don't want to block real users or state that a person has a disease when they don't)
- Biopsy confirmation: High precision (only treat actual cancer) â†’ fewer false positives
