# Obsidian

An amazing video to deepdive Obsidian and try to, once and for all, start using it. Some food for thought:

- when quoting something, put them in **bold** so to understand that is a quote
	- then, underneath, write with your own words about it
- Try to keep the notes short, in less than 500 words. The word counter on the bottom right is helpful for that
- Try to use five tags at max, to make it cohesive and less prone to errors

#### Questions to be answered:
- should I write in English only or should I use Portuguese?
