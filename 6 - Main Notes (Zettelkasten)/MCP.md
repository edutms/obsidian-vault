# What is  MCP?
MCP stands for Model Context Protocol and it is an open stardard, open-source framework introduced by Anthropic to standardize the way AI systems such as LLMs integrate and share data with external tools, systems and data sources. MCP provides then a universal interface for file reading, function execution and contextual prompts handling.
