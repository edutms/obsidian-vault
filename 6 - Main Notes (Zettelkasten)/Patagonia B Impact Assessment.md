# Patagonia B Impact Assessment

Reading the Patagonia Assessment for the B Impact, we can see that they really dive deep on the response and are locked-in on having this kind of certification in place. 

### Governance

Most questions related to governance got the top score in there. So for example, on the pct of full time employees that have social or environmental mission-related statements responsibilities on job description **and** on performance evaluation are over 50%.

### Workers

Questions on living wage (aka minimum wage), healthcare plan, internal promotions pct, training/education reinbursment, second parental leave, etc. are all scored with a good one, instead of having only. 

### Community

Banking institutions the workers receive their comp, how many are locally sourced (nearby 500miles), civic engagement, time-off for volunteering service, female management

### Environment

Questions regarding how many of the products are certified with environmental certs, which products have in their design the thought for Environmental issues. One of the IBM is regarding toxin remediation/reduction.
