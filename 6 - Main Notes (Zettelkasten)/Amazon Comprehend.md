# What is Amazon Comprehend?
Amazon Comprehend is Amazon's NLP solution for text-based documentation, capable of [[Name Entity Recognition]], [[Sentiment Analysis]]. language detection, PII Redaction and more NLP-based solutions. It's useful with text based documents only, so if you intend using it for PDF document analysis it's commendable to use first a text-extraction solution such as [[Amazon Textract]] or open-source Python libraries such as [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)
