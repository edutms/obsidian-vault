# Pearson correlation

The Pearson correlation measures the linear correlation of two datasets. Ranging -1 to 1, where 1 is a perfect positive correlation and -1 a negative correlation.

It can have:
### Cosine
The cosine similarity measures the cosine angle of two non-zero vectores into a multidimensional space, and it's used in text similarity.

### Manhatan
 Manhatan distance - L1 norm calculatesd the absolute diff between two points coordinates. It is the sum of the differences of their corresponding coordinates.

### Euclidian

L2 norm is the Euclidian distance in a straight-line between two points in a multidimensional space.

### Dot

Measusres the similarity of two vectors in space.


## When to use
It can be used when both variables are of quantitative nature, they are normally distributed, and often you have no outliers in your data.
