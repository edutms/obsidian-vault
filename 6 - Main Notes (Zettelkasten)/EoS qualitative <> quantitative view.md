# EoS qualitative <> quantitative view

- Benchmark companies against eachother
- Talk to Luana Messena on how can I better undestand the Standards

##### Why we are moving out from the 80-point treshold to a non-scoring model?

The idea is to move from a point-based perspective to avoid "criteria inflation" and to also prevent companies comparing points against each other. Another goal is to make the Assessment with a Do Not Meet, Meet and Exceeds criterias for question completion, i.e:

##### IBMs (Impact Business Model)
Feedback was received that the new standards focused more on operational impacts, letting go the focus of the IBMs and their "secret sauces of B Corp Ceritification". To cover this, Addendas will be added to each topic to identify the unique impacts companies have over that specific topic.
```
Data from companies’ performance on the B Impact Assessment also indicates the importance of performance on IBMs/Industry Addenda in the B Corp community’s overall achievement of B Corp Certification:

- 86% of B Corps perform on Impact Business Model/Industry Addenda.
- Two-thirds of all certified companies needed IBM points in order to become a B Corp. 
    - On average, IBM points make up 22% of a company's score.
```

##### Fair Wages topic
Most crucial for quantitative data to be recorded, also, we can highlight the possibility of encountering biases when dealing with it.
- Tech and investing business companies with higher or exceeding salaries - but isn't it the overall trend of a tech/investing company?
- Creating tresholds would help us identifying those cases and leave us with a better idea on what we want to have

Living wage definition

```
Living Wage

Remuneration received for a standard workweek by a worker in a particular place sufficient to afford a decent standard of living for the worker and her or his [or their] family. Elements of a decent standard of living include food, water, housing, education, health care, transportation, clothing, and other essential needs including provision for unexpected events. ([Global Living Wage Coalition](https://www.globallivingwage.org/about/what-is-a-living-wage/))
```

In talks with Emily, the idea is to tackle Fair Wages topic first to understand which questions would benefit of having a quantitative option to reply from. I will be listing them bellow:

###### FW1.4
The company calculates their gender wage gap.
- this could be an interesting one, to get the percentage on gender wage gap\
###### FW1.6
If not 50% reduction, we could still bring value by getting the % drop. Or else, even consider ranks above 50% reduction to exceeds criteria
###### FW3.1
Having the % of contracts mapped as quantitative value.
###### FW3.2
% of the **mapped**  living wage/income gaps

###### FW3.3
Having the % of contracts mapped as quantitative value.

###### FW3.4
% of the **mapped**  living wage/income gaps
