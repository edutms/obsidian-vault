What to go over:
- how you see the IBM being useful in the future EoS? Do you see it changing a lot?
- Do you think we can manage to start segmenting companies based on tiers?
	- What are the downsides of this approach? And upsides?
		- Since the EoS does not want to distinguish between the B Lab corps but instead create a fostering envinronment, would this be a good approach?
		- Could we create an "internal" segmentation to assist and direct analyst on prioritization?
- Complete redesign for the IBMs
