# What is  Unit Test?

Unit test is a software development practice where individual components of the code are tested in isolation to verify if they behave as expected. A unit is typically the smallest testable part of an application - a function, a method, a class.


## Descriptions and Core principles

Unit tests should be:
- fast - quick execution to enable frequent running
- independant - do not rely on external systems like dbs and APIs
- repeatable - produce consistent results regardless of envinronment
- self-validating - pass or fail statements does not need manual validation
- isolated - test one specific part of the code in isolation
