# What is  Unit Test?

Unit test is a software development practice where individual components of the code are tested in isolation to verify if they behave as expected. A unit is typically the smallest testable part of an application - a function, a method, a class.


## Descriptions and Core principles

Unit tests should be:
- fast
- independant 
- repeatable
- self-validating
- isolated
