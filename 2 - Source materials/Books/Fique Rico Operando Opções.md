### About

Stock option introduction book. The goal is that I've always been interested in option trading but never did anything regarding it, so I'm picking up this book once again to understand and to organize a small portion of my portfolio dedicated to it. I believe I will mostly use it to buy puts on Petrobras and Vale options (maybe WEGE3) - but to be discussed later.

#### Chapter 1

Options are derivatives as their value derives from another asset --> so a stock option derives it's value from a stock.
Options allow you to get a directional position related to the asset.
